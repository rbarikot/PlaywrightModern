      - paragraph [ref=e26]: "For security reasons, browsers do not allow web pages to access files and execute commands. However, the PVCS Web Client requires access to execute the following operations: Add Workfiles, Get, View, Check Out, Edit, Check In, Show Difference, and Show Merge. Access is also required to read your OS username for project databases using the Host Id login source."

      - paragraph [ref=e28]: You will not be able to use any of the operations listed above but can still use other operations providing your project database does not use the Host Id login source.
